"""
Monkey-patch for ZLibStorage and RelStorage to work correctly
together.

This does two things. First, it makes sure that `new_instance`
maintains the correct wrapper.

Second, it makes RelStorage call super when 'registerDB' is done. This
is needed to get conflict resolution to work correctly; without
this call, the ConflictResolution class doesn't know to uncompress the
pickled data. This same modification has to be carried through to `new_instance`.
