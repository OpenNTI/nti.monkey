"""
A hack to help us ensure that we are loading and monkey-patching
the desired parts of multi-zodb-check-refs before it gets started. Needed
with relstorage.

.. note:: You must have the MySQL-python driver installed, as we
	cannot monkey patch to use umysqldb due to errors. See
	that patch for details.

Note that we cannot use pypy; :mod:`zc.zodbgc` uses ``Unpickler.unload()``,
which seems to be found only in cPython2 implementations. We would have to
replace its dependency on that with the new :mod:`zodbpickle` package (and
even then its not clear this would work; it seems that noload is only
available in the C code, not the python version).
