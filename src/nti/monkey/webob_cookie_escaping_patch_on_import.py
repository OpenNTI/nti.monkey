"""
Versions of :mod:`webob.cookie` up through at least 1.2.3 are overly
aggressive when it comes to escaping the values of the Set-Cookie
header. This is fixed in 1.3 so this patch does nothing there.

According to `RFC 6265 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-4.1.1>`, only a few values
have to be escaped: control characters, double quote, comma, semicolon, and backslash. Notably, the at-sign, @, is
allowed. However, webob leaves this on its list.

Importing this module (and calling patch) adjusts the webob cookie
functions to not escape these values.
